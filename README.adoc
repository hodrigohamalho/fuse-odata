= Fuse Odata Example

This is a very basic simple project showing how to expose OData using Olingo4 JPA processor 
and consume it using Red Hat Fuse (Camel).

This project consists of two partes the server part (odata-server) and client (fuse-odata-client).

== Odata Server 

=== Pre requirements

    git clone https://github.com/SAP/olingo-jpa-processor-v4
    cd olingo-jpa-processor-v4
    mvn clean install 

=== Build 

    mvn clean install 

=== Run 

The build phase generates a simple web application, servlet based so you need to 
deploy in a web server like Tomcat or Wildfly. 


This sample was built using the Tutorial Session of olingo-jpa-processor-v4: https://github.com/SAP/olingo-jpa-processor-v4/blob/develop/jpa-tutorial/Tutorials/Introduction/Introduction.md


=== Test

    http://localhost:8080/odata-Server/Demo.svc/BusinessPartners?$format=JSON


== Fuse odata client 

=== Build

    mvn clean package 

=== Run 

    mvn spring-boot:run 

Check the logs.
